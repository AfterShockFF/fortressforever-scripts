exec userconfig.cfg
//  Place any global binds/aliases/scripts into the userconfig.cfg file and specifics into each <classname>.cfg
//  IMPORTANT: The userconfig.cfg file DOES NOT auto-execute.
//  It can only be executed in console with "exec userconfig.cfg" or by the <classname>.cfg files using that command as above.
//  If you are reading this line, then just leave this file in the cfg folder and the userconfig.cfg file will work fine.
